	Abstract = {Explore the world of Virtual Reality by building immersive and fun VR projects using Unity 3DAbout This BookLearn the basic principles of virtual reality applications and get to know how they differ from games and desktop appsBuild various types of VR experiences, including diorama, first-person characters, riding on rails, 360 degree projections, and social VRA project-based guide that teaches you to use Unity to develop VR applications, which can be experienced with devices such as the Oculus Rift or Google CardboardIn DetailWhat is consumer ``virtual reality''? Wearing a head-mounted display you view stereoscopic 3D scenes. You can look around by moving your head, and walk around using hand controls or motion sensors. You are engaged in a fully immersive experience. On the other hand, Unity is a powerful game development engine that provides a rich set of features such as visual lighting, materials, physics, audio, special effects, and animation for creating 2D and 3D games. Unity 5 has become the leading platform for building virtual reality games, applications and experiences for this new generation of consumer VR devices.Using a practical and project-based approach, this book will educate you about the specifics of virtual reality development in Unity.You will learn how to use Unity to develop VR applications which can be experienced with devices such as the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard. We will then learn how to engage with virtual worlds from a third person and first person character point of view. Furthermore, you will explore the technical considerations especially important and possibly unique to VR. The projects in the book will demonstrate how to build a variety of VR experiences. You will be diving into the Unity 3D game engine via the interactive Unity Editor as well as C-Sharp programming.By the end of the book, you will be equipped to develop rich, interactive virtual reality experiences using Unity.So, let's get to it!What You Will LearnCreate 3D scenes with Unity and Blender while learning about world space and scaleBuild and run VR applications for consumer headsets including Oculus Rift and Google CardboardBuild interactive environments with physics, gravity, animations, and lighting using the Unity engineExperiment with various user interface (UI) techniques that you can use in your VR applicationsImplement the first-person and third-person experiences that use only head motion gestures for inputCreate animated walkthroughs, use 360-degree media, and build multi-user social VR experiencesLearn about the technology and psychology of VR including rendering, performance and VR motion sicknessGain introductory and advanced experience in Unity programming with the C\# languageWho This Book Is ForIf you're a non-programmer unfamiliar with 3D computer graphics, or experienced in both but new to virtual reality, and are interested in building your own VR games or applications then this book is for you. Any experience in Unity is an advantage.Style and approachThis book takes a practical, project-based approach to teach specifics of virtual reality development in Unity. Using a reader-friendly approach, this book will not only provide detailed step-by-step instructions but also discuss the broader context and applications covered within.Downloading the example code for this book.

You'll start by understanding the capabilities of the Rift hardware. Then you'll follow interesting and instantly relevant examples that walk you through programming real applications using the Oculus SDK. Examples are provided for both using the Oculus C API directly and for using Unity, a popular development and 3D graphics engine, with the Oculus Unity integration package.About the BookVirtual reality has long been the domain of researchers and developers with access to specialized hardware and proprietary tools. With the appearance of the Oculus Rift VR headset, the game has changed. Using standard programming tools and the intuitive Oculus SDKs, you can deliver powerful immersive games, simulations, and other virtual experiences that finally nail the feeling of being in the middle of the action.Oculus Rift in Action teaches you how to create 3D games and other virtual reality experiences for the Oculus Rift. You'll explore the Rift hardware through examples of real applications using the Oculus SDK and both the Oculus C API and the Unity 3D graphics engine. Along the way, you'll get practical guidance on how to use the Rift's sensors to produce fluid VR experiences.Experience with C++, C\#, or another OO language is assumed.What's InsideCreating immersive VRIntegrating the Rift with the Unity 3D SDKImplementing the mathematics of 3DAvoiding motion-sickness triggersAbout the AuthorsBrad Davis is an active VR developer who maintains a great set of example Rift applications on Github.

	Abstract = {Virtual Reality systems enable organizations to cut costs and time, maintain financial and organizational control over the development process, digitally evaluate products before having them created, and allow for greater creative exploration. In this book, VR developers Alan Craig, William Sherman, and Jeffrey Will examine a comprehensive collection of current,unique, and foundational VR applications in a multitude of fields, such as business, science, medicine, art, entertainment, and public safety among others. An insider's view of what works, what doesn't work, and why, Developing Virtual Reality Applications explores core technical information and background theory as well as the evolution of key applications from their genesis to their most current form. Developmental techniques are cross-referenced between different applications linking information to describe overall VR trends and fundamental best practices. This synergy, coupled with the most up to date research being conducted, provides a hands-on guide for building applications, and an enhanced, panoramic view of VR development. Developing Virtual Reality Applications is an indispensable one-stop reference for anyone working in this burgeoning field. Dozens of detailed application descriptions provide practical ideas for VR development in ALL areas of interest!Development techniques are cross referenced between different application areas, providing fundamental best practices!Includes a media-rich companion website with hours of footage from application demonstrations},

@incollection{okita,
	Abstract = {Designed to give you enough familiarity in a programming language to be immediately productive, Learning C\# Programming with Unity 3D provides the basics of programming and brings you quickly up to speed. Organized into easy-to-follow lessons, the book covers how C\# is used to make a game in Unity3D. After reading this book, you will be armed with the knowledge required to feel confident in learning more. You'll have what it takes to at least look at code without your head spinning. Writing a massive multiplayer online role-playing game is quite hard, of course, but learning how to write a simple behavior isn't. Like drawing, you start off with the basics such as spheres and cubes. After plenty of practice, you'll be able to create a real work of art. This applies to writing code---you start off with basic calculations, then move on to the logic that drives a complex game. By the end of this book, you will have the skills to be a capable programmer, or at least know what is involved with how to read and write code. Although you could go online and find videos and tutorials, there is a distinct advantage when it comes to learning things in order and in one place. Most online tutorials for C\# are scattered, disordered, and incohesive. It's difficult to find a good starting point, and even more difficult to find a continuous list of tutorials to bring you to any clear understanding of the C\# programming language. This book not only gives you a strong foundation, but puts you on the path to game development.},
